# This file encodes a simplicial torus where every pair of vertices is
# connected by an edge.  It was originally described in the paper
# 
#    Ákos Császar, "A Polyhedron without Diagonals," Acta Sci. Math (1949)
#
# Vertex coordinates, indices, and faces are precisely as described in this
# paper.  Note, however, that the faces are not globally oriented, which may
# cause problems with software that does not check for orientation.  See the
# file Csaszar-oriented.obj for an oriented version.
